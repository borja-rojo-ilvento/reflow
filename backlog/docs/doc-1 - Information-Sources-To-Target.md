# Information Sources to be able to pull from

## Twitter

The scope of this is going to be for a currated list of individual accounts. Potensially, gathering more information about sentiment. Recency would also need to be supported, so that context can be time boxed for recurring stuff.

## arXiv

Research paper targeting. May need to support specific paper lookup

## Substack

## "Google Searching 'vc AI reports' on Saturday the last 7 days"

This is a technique that Sam Folco was describing for gathering information about AI targeting a particular curration class and recency. This is smart! Getting information filtered through a specific cohort can add particular color that might be hard to get through mass information.

Further, this can be extended to other cohorts. What about academics? AI Researchers and firms, like Google Deepmind and others? They are also a curration cohort, which would add a different flavor.

Note, that I am describing these currations with different flavors, and it may be valid to seed a prompt in reviewing this information with descriptions of these cohorts, which can inform an LLM about bias.
